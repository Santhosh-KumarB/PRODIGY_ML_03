# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification 🐱🐶

This project is part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship (Task-03)**.

The objective of this task is to build an **image classification model** that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

---

## 📌 Task Objective
To implement an image classification system that classifies images as **Cat** or **Dog** using a deep learning approach.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- TensorFlow Datasets
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 📊 Dataset
Cats vs Dogs Dataset  
(Source: TensorFlow Datasets)

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. Loaded the Cats vs Dogs dataset
2. Visualized sample images
3. Preprocessed images (resizing and normalization)
4. Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
5. Trained the model for a few epochs
6. Tested predictions on sample images

---

## ✅ Results
The model was able to classify images of cats and dogs with reasonable accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs for image classification tasks.
